# Melodica Music Player

Melodica Music Player is a simple and versatile music player developed as part of the Data Structures course project for 2nd year Sem1 at EUI . Built entirely in C++, this music player showcases custom implementations of fundamental data structures such as **Linked Lists**, **Queues**, **Stacks**, and **Binary Search Trees** to power its core functionalities. Melodica comes in two versions: a **GUI version** built using C++/CLR and WinForms (inspired by Spotify and Anghami) and a **CLI version** for a lightweight, command-line experience.

Whether you're a music enthusiast or a developer interested in data structures, Melodica offers a practical and educational example of how these concepts can be applied in real-world applications.
